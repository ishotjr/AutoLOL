In 2002, I had a thought: wouldn't it be great if you could convey messages to other drivers with greater precision than the established turn signal and *gesture-based* conventions?  This was the era of texting on dumbphones, before emoji or social media apps or any of the other ways that we can now more expressively convey our feelings than with raw text.  Thus, I had the idea for a simple system (whose road legality I have yet to investigate) whereby emoticons could easily be displayed to other drivers to convey apology, thankfulness, or...whatever the situation required.  Back then I had absolutely no hardware skills, having focused my schooling and professional career on bits rather than atoms - but having dabbled in hardware as a hobby for 8 or so years now, I'm hopefully to the point where I can knock out an MVP over a weekend, instead of such ideas remaining dreams... :D
